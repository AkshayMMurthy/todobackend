I created a todo list api to do the following:


Get all todos - GET API

Add a todo - POST API

Edit the todo - PUT API

Delete the todo - DELETE API

MongoDB has been used as the database

index.js contains all the APIs

/api/todos/ - GET

/api/todos/ - POST ("title":"<title-name">)

/api/todos/:id - PUT 

/api/todos/:id - DELETE
