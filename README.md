I created a todo list api to do the following:


Get all todos - GET API

Add a todo - POST API

Edit the todo - PUT API

Delete the todo - DELETE API

MongoDB has been used as the database





Deployed on https://todobackend-htch.onrender.com/ If testing please wait for some time to get responses as Render scales down free tier services after inactivity.

https://todobackend-htch.onrender.com/api/todos/ - GET

https://todobackend-htch.onrender.com/api/todos/ - POST ("title":"<title-name">)

https://todobackend-htch.onrender.com/api/todos/:id - PUT 

https://todobackend-htch.onrender.com/api/todos/:id - DELETE
