I created a todo list api to do the following:


Get all todos - GET API
Add a todo - POST API
Edit the todo - PUT API
Delete the todo - DELETE API

MongoDB has been used as the database





Deployed on https://todofrontend-tfal.onrender.com. If testing please wait for some time to get responses as Render scales down free tier services after inactivity.
